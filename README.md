## 3. Sales Dashboard Insights Summary

**Sales Performance**

- **Trend Analysis**: Evaluate how Total Orders and Gross Revenue have changed compared to previous month. This helps identify growth trends or declines in sales performance.
- **Day of Week**: Identify which days have the highest and lowest Total Orders and Gross Revenue. This can help optimize staffing, promotional efforts, and inventory levels for peak days.
- **Months **: Determine peak shopping hours. This can assist in scheduling promotions and improving website performance during high-demand months.

**Customer Behavior**

- **Average Order Value (AOV)**: Analyze how AOV change over time. A rising AOV suggests that customers are spending more per transaction, while a declining AOV could indicate reduced spending or promotions affecting spending behavior. Consider strategies to boost AOV, such as bundling products, offering discounts on higher-value orders, or implementing loyalty programs.
- **Payment Method**: Analyze the distribution of payment types. If a particular payment method dominates, consider enhancing support and promotions for less popular methods to improve their adoption.
